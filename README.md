# What to do
1) Load 'MainTest' scene
2) Set 'Theme' as MainTest's theme
3) Add 'Sub01' and 'Sub02' as children (or they may already be there, just check it)
4) Press 'Change Font' button to see how the font changes only for the Options Button and not the normal ones

(The Theme may be also asking for textures, but if there is an error, just reset them to default)
